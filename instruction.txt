This file represent an instruction guid to use Ex2 for graph construct.

first step ---- construct vertex's : *************************************
To construct vertex in your desired place 
Go to Node class and construct your vertex
Name of vertex -- key.
Place of vertex - 3Dpoint (x,y,z).
Weight of vertex - for algorithems

second step ---- construct edge's : ***********************************
To construct edge in your desired vertex
Go to Edge class and construct your edge
src -- the source Node(vertex) of the edge.
dest -- the destanation Node of the edge.
Weight of edge -- for algorithems **importan for the smallest path for vertex to vertex.

third step ---- construct graph : *************************************
Now construct your grapg with your selected Node and Edge
Go to DGraph class, palce all your Node and edges in a suitable set 
Example --- > Node[] = {n0 , n1 , n2 , n3}    ,  Edge[] = {e1 , e2 ,e3 ,e4} as many as you like to add.
After your put yor set's in DGraph constructor the grapg is connected 

Print your graph ---- construct edge's : *************************************
For viewing the graph 
Go to gui packege construct a new gui constructor, add youe graph 
Run and enjoy.
